// Force-deletes trashed rows older than config('familywell.trash_days'). Scheduled daily (routes/console.php).

// crash mid-way just leaves the rest for the next run. Runs without a tenant (no CurrentFamily in the
// scheduler), so it covers every family. forceDelete() per model, not a bulk delete, so model events
// fire (Spend removes its receipt photos from storage in `forceDeleting`).

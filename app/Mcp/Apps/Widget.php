/**
 * One MCP Apps widget (https://modelcontextprotocol.io/extensions/apps/overview): a self-contained HTML
 * page the host (Claude, ChatGPT, ...) renders in a sandboxed iframe next to a tool's result. A tool opts
 * in with `protected ?string $app = '<widget>'` (App\Mcp\Tool adds the `_meta.ui.resourceUri`).
 *
 * Every widget is the shared runtime (resources/mcp-apps/core.{css,js}) plus its own resources/mcp-apps/
 * <widget>.js, all inlined: no network, so the CSP stays at the secure default (no external domains).
 * The widget renders the tool result it is pushed and changes things only by calling our existing write
 * tools through the host, so scopes, sharing rules, notifications and realtime are exactly the MCP ones.
 *
 * ponytail: one class instantiated per widget (FamilywellServer::boot) instead of a class per widget;
 * each instance is a plain listed resource, which every host handles (templates are less supported).

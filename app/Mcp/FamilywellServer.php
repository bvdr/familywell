        Familywell is a family organiser: shared to-do lists, shopping lists, expenses and notes.
        This connection acts for one signed-in person inside ONE family, chosen when they connected.
        Everything you read or change belongs to that family and respects that person's sharing rules.
        Call get_family first to see the family, its members, and what this connection may read or change.
        Deletes are reversible for 30 days (see the *_list_deleted and *_restore tools).
        Every entity includes a `url` you can give the person to open it in Familywell.

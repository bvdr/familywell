// Public demo family: wiped and re-seeded at the top of every hour. It was nightly at first, but
// visitors vandalize the demo within hours, so hourly keeps it presentable. Runs on the prod
// `scheduler` worker (schedule:work); withoutOverlapping so a slow reset never races the next tick.
// Module-owned schedules live in their service providers; this one is core, so it lives here.
// See App\Console\Commands\DemoReset.

// Reversible delete: remove items that sat in the trash past config('familywell.trash_days'). Daily, off-peak.
// See App\Console\Commands\PurgeTrash and App\Support\Trash\Trash.
